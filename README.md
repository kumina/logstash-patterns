# Logstash patterns by Kumina

**Important** We no longer maintain this!

These are all kinds of patterns we use for our [logstash](http://www.logstash.net/) processors. Some are adapted from the [included](https://github.com/logstash/logstash/tree/master/patterns) patterns, some are written from scratch. These patterns are a part of the Kumina [puppet-generic](https://github.com/kumina/puppet-generic) repository.
